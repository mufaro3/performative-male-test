      The Purity Test has historically served as a segue from O-week to true college life at Rice.<br />
      It's a voluntary opportunity for O-week groups to bond, and for students to track the maturation<br />
      of their experiences throughout college.

      Caution: This is not a bucket list. Completion of all items on this test will likely result in death.
